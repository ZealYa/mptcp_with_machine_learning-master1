/**
* TODO setup callbacks in order to know if we shall accept the addition
* \brief The MPTCP path manager tracks ADD_ADDR/REM_ADDR in case the user wants to later open new subflows.
* It is possible to use callbacks from the MPTCP metasocket to be notified in case of a new ADD_ADDR.
* Thus it is possible to immediately create the desired subflows
*
RFC6824
   The Address IDs of the subflow used in the initial SYN exchange of
   the first subflow in the connection are implicit, and have the value
   zero.  A host MUST store the mappings between Address IDs and
   addresses BOTH for itself and the remote host.  An implementation
   will also need to know which local and remote Address IDs are
   associated with which established subflows, for when addresses are
   removed from a local or remote host.
